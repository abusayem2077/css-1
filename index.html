	<article>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the <strong>Avengers</strong>, and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Following his fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man. </article>

		<h2>The Avengers</h2>
		<p>The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals, with either superpowers or other special characteristics. Though primarily affiliated with the interests of the United States of America, the group's purpose was to protect global stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats. The Avengers were first assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a result of the Avengers Initiative, when Loki invaded Earth with his Chitauri army. The team, consisting of Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye defeated Loki and went their separate ways for a while. </p>
